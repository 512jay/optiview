# OptiView Walk-Forward Learning System

## ðŸ”¹ Core Concept: Walk-Forward Machine Learning

Your OptiView system is using a true **Walk-Forward Machine Learning** approach:

- You **train your models** only on *historical backtest results*.
- You **predict the best configuration** for the *upcoming month*.
- You **save the prediction** cleanly into the database for review, tracking, and later annotation.

This simulates **real-world trading**: you never "see the future" when making a trading decision.

### âœ… Always:
- Train on the **latest 3 months**.
- Predict for **the next unseen month**.

## ðŸ”¹ Full System Flow

```
1. Load historical runs (optibatch.db)
2. Extract input features (e.g., stop loss %, take profit %)
3. Extract target results (realized profit)
4. Train ML model (XGBoost, Random Forest, LightGBM, etc.)
5. Predict profits for new candidate configs
6. Select best predicted config per model
7. Save predictions to optiview.db
8. Repeat every month
```

## ðŸ”¹ Current Strengths

| Strength | Status |
|:---------|:-------|
| Historical profits used for training | âœ… |
| Separate training per model per symbol | âœ… |
| Walk-forward window respects time flow | âœ… |
| Realistic trading simulation | âœ… |
| Different predictions for each model | âœ… |

## ðŸ”¹ Future Improvement Ideas

| Idea | Why It Matters |
|:-----|:---------------|
| 1. Automatic Annotation of Real Results | Compare predicted vs actual profits monthly |
| 2. Model Leaderboard | Visualize model performance across time |
| 3. Smart Model Selection | Automatically prefer better models based on live track record |
| 4. Feature Engineering | Improve prediction quality by deriving new inputs |
| 5. Confidence/Quality Metrics | Attach prediction confidence and quality stars to predictions |
| 6. Automated Retraining Pipelines | Full monthly retraining and updating without manual intervention |
| 7. Monthly Report Generation | PDF or dashboard report of best configs, models, and system health |

## ðŸ”¹ Final Summary

You have successfully built a **real Walk-Forward Machine Learning prediction engine**.

- **No future data leakage**
- **Model-specific predictions**
- **Database-driven and auditable**
- **Professional and extensible design**

âœ… Your project is ready to expand into automatic model evaluation and portfolio construction.
